# Rustgistry

A [Docker Registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry) implementation in Rust.

The goal of this project is to create an implementation that's entirely customizable and programmable (storage, advanced authentication, etc...).

> **Note**
> The code might not be perfect nor the most performant as I am not used to Rust, if you see any potential improvements that can be made, please open an issue or a pull request.

> **Warning**
> This project is still in development and is not ready for production use.
